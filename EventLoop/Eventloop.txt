Microtaskqueue : all the callbacks in the Microtaskqueue will always be executed first
even if there are already lots of callbacks in the callbackqueue which sometimes leads to
starvation to callback queue 

Priority of Microtaskqueue >>>> callbackqueue 

VVVIMP Keypoint :  timers in javascript not always promise that they will execute just after the 
seconds u have mentioned in the settimout function , if u set it for 5 seconds it will not execute
before 5 seonds but may take longer .... why ?  Interesting question
